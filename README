1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The last project for CS 210 was to write c++ code for a grocery store that could allow a user to input an item and the code return how many of that item were in a .txt file.
 
2. What did you do particularly well?
For this assignment, I believe I did a good job writing clear, understandable code with good comments for extra readability.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have done better creating a header file instead of containing all of my code inside on CPP script.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part was to accurately count how many items were in the text file and have it read it appropriately so that it output the correct number, I was lucky to have a friend experienced with c++ who was able to help me have it read each new line as it was supposed to.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I had never used c++ much before this class so just having that knowledge in general is huge to me, I also feel like I learned a lot about classes and understand more about their structure at least within c++ than I had before.
 
6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I believe I made the programmable readable and maintainable by having very specific comments and clear sections/blocks of code which say exactly what they do and how. For future reference, I will make it more maintainable by keeping things separated and not inside one main .cpp file
